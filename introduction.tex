\chapter*{Introduction}

You just looked at yet another introduction to Category Theory. The
subject mostly consists of a lot of definitions that are related each
others and we wrote the book to collect all of them in one
place to be easy checked and updated in future when we decide to refresh
our knowledge about the field of math. Therefore the book was written mostly
for our category theory studying 
purposes but we will appreciate if somebody else find it useful.

The topics(chapters) cover the base definitions
(\mynameref{def:object}, \mynameref{def:morphism} and
\mynameref{def:category}), \mynameref{def:functor},
\mynameref{def:nt}, \mynameref{def:monad} and also include important
results from the category theory such as Yoneda's lemma (see
\cref{sec:yoneda}) and Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence (see
\cref{sec:curry_howard_lambek}).  

There are a lot of 
examples in each chapter. The examples cover different category
theory application areas. We assume that the reader is familiar with
the corresponding area and the example(s) can be passed if not. I.e.
anyone can choose the suitable example(s) for (s)he. 

The most important examples are related to the set theory. The set
theory and category theory are very close related. Each one can be
considered as an alternative view to another one.

There are a lot of examples from programming languages which include
Haskell, Scala, C++. The source files for programming languages 
examples (Haskell, C++, Scala) can be found on github repositories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Haskell: \cite{github:cattheory_hs_examples}
\item Scala: \cite{github:cattheory_scala_examples}
\item C++: \cite{github:cattheory_cpp_examples}
\end{itemize}

The examples from physics are related to quantum mechanics that is the
most known for me. For the examples We were inspired by the Bob Coecke
article \cite{bib:arxiv:Bob_Coecke_2008}.
